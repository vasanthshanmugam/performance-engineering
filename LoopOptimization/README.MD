Key Points:

Console Output Inside Loop: Each iteration of the loop performs a Console.WriteLine operation.
Performance Issue: Console I/O operations are relatively slow compared to CPU operations. Writing to the console one million times introduces a significant overhead.

Optimizations:

Batching Output:

StringBuilder: Accumulates messages in memory instead of directly writing them to the console in each iteration.
Batch Size: The loop aggregates messages in batches (e.g., 10,000 messages at a time) and prints them all at once. This reduces the frequency of console I/O operations.
Reduced Console I/O:

Minimized I/O Operations: Instead of one million individual Console.WriteLine calls, the code performs fewer Console.Write operations (printing batches), which is much more efficient.
Single Console Output: By reducing the number of times the console is accessed, the overall time spent on I/O operations is significantly decreased.
Impact on Performance
Console Output Overhead:

Unoptimized: The Console.WriteLine method is called a million times, resulting in a large number of I/O operations, which is slow.
Optimized: Output is aggregated in memory and then written to the console in larger chunks, reducing the number of I/O operations and thus speeding up the execution.
Memory Usage vs. Performance:

Memory: While using StringBuilder consumes additional memory for storing the batched messages, this is a trade-off for reducing the time spent on I/O operations.
Execution Time: Aggregating and batching reduces the total execution time significantly by minimizing I/O overhead.
Summary
The optimization primarily reduces the time spent on expensive console I/O operations by:

Aggregating output: Using StringBuilder to collect multiple lines before writing them to the console.
Batching: Printing large batches of messages at once instead of many small operations.
These changes lead to a more efficient execution, demonstrating how optimizing loops and reducing expensive operations can result in faster performance.
